# Distributed Source Code Management with git

An introduction to distributed source code management with git.

![git Logo](files/Git-logo.png)

---

## Source Code Management / Version Control

---

### What do you want from source code management systems?

- **Experimentation** without risk of loosing data
- **Documentation** of the development process
- Easy **backup**
- Easy **collaboration** with (remote) co-workers
- **No overhead** (file cluttering, file locks, server management)

---

## An overview of git

---

### What is git?

A distributed version control (DVC) and source code management (SCM) system

- A content(!) tracker, not a file tracker.
- A command line tool
- Available for all platforms
- Free and open software
- Leight-weight

---

### The git command-line

Git is a powerful command-line tool you can use on Linux, Mac OS and Windows:

<!-- langauge: lang-sh -->

	$ git

![Screenshot of the git command line](files/Command-Line/Screenshot-git-command-line.png)

### History of git

Developed by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel development in 2005 as an replacement for [BitKeeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper).

- The initial version of git has been written by Torvalds in two weeks.
- Created out of necessity and frustration about the existing source code control sytems (such as CVS).

There is a good Google Tech Talk with Linus Torvalds where he talks about the history and motivation behind git:

---

### git today

- The git code is publicly available and is tracked with ... git (available at [github.com/git](http://github.com/git/git/))
- The code is activly maintained by > 50 developers
- In 2012 git has been used by 27% of all professional software developers (see: [Eclipse Foundation Survey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)#Adoption))
- Github one of the largest git hosters has reached [3 milliion users](https://github.com/blog/1382-three-million-users) in Januar 2013.

### Why the name "git"?

git := British slang meaning "a rotten person"

> I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git.”
> - Linus Torvals

---

### Key features of git

- Git does not track single files but a whole filesystem/folder structure by its content
- Git is distributed without a central server
- Every repository contains the complete history
- Git is optimized for rapid branching and merging
- Easy synchronization with other repositories over existing protocols such as http, ftp, rsync or ssh

---

### Distributed Version Control

> Being distributed very much means that you do not have one central
> location that keeps track of your data. No single place is more
> important than any other single place.
> - Linus Torvals

- no central server
- no central repository
- no special permission

---

### Distributed development workflows

git supports all kinds of developement workflows and branching strategries (because of its distributed nature):

**Subversion-Style workflow**

One central repository where one or more developers pull from and commit to:

![Illustration of the Subversion-Style workflow](files/Distributed-Workflows/Git-Distributed-Workflow-Subversion-Style.png)


**Integration Manager Workflow**

One single person (the "integration manager") pulls changes from different sources/developers, combines them in his or her repository and pushes the combined commits to a central "blessed" repository:

![Illustration of the Integration Manager Workflow](files/Distributed-Workflows/Git-Distributed-Workflow-Integration-Manager.png)


**Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow**

In this **network of trust** a "dictator" pulls from the repositories of her or her trusted "lieutenants" which on their side pull from their trusted developers. The dictator integrates the changes from the lieutenants and then pushes to a central blessed repository.

![Illustration of the Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow](files/Distributed-Workflows/Git-Distributed-Workflow-Dictator-and-Lieutenants.png)

### How does git cover the things you expect from a SCM?

**Experimenting without loosing changes**

- Git allows you to have multiple experimentation or feature branches which do not interfere with the master branch.
- You can keep your experiments for yourself - your co-workers don't need to know about your experiments if you don't want to
- You can switch between branches very quickly

**Documentation**

- Git encourages developers to commit early and often

**Backup**

- Every developer has a full-copy of the repository
- Every repository contains the full history
- Just copy to the repository folder to another location and you are done

**Collaboration**

- Every developer can work on his or her own branch
- Easy exchange of commits
- Branches and even single commits can be easily exchanged and merged


**No overhead**

- All git needs is a ".git" folder in your repository
- Git does not hold file-locks
- Developers don't have do asks for permission before editing a file
- You don't need special infrastructure to exchange commits - all you need is HTTP or SSH

---

### What distinguishes git from centralized SCMs ...

... such as Team Foundation Server or SVN (Apache Subversion):

- no need for a server
- no central database
- no need for permission management
- no special infrastructure
- no need to be afraid of branching and merging

---

### Why do I think we could benefit from using git ?

With our centralized version control system branching and merging is so painful for us that we hardly do it.

A **healthy branching strategy** would look something like this:
![Illustration of a health branching strategy which utilizes multiple branches](files/Why-use-Git/Healthy-Branching-Strategy.png)

But opposed to that, this is how our unhealthy branching "strategy" looks like ... because branching and merging is (considered) hard:
![Illustration of an ubhealth development strategy which does not use branching](files/Why-use-Git/Unhealthy-Branching-Strategy.png)

---

### Other distributed version control systems

There are other distributed SCMs out there, but not that many ...

**Mercurial**

- Mercurial is quite similar to git
- Written in Python
- I think the GUI tools for Mercurial are much better than those for git
- Mercurial is not as fast as git (at least this is my experience)

**BitKeeper**

- commercial product
- has been used by for the kernel development until 2005

**Bazaar**

- developed by Canonical
- written in Python

**Monotone**

- git is influenced by Monotone
- is not as widely used as Mercurial or Bazaar

## Setting up git on Windows

- Installation
- Configuration
	- Username, Email
	- Merge Tools

---

## Installation on Windows

---

### Installation Wizard

For the installation of git goto [http://git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com) and download the latest version for Windows and execute the installer.

![Screenshot of the git installation wizard start screen](files/Git-Installation-Process/Screenshot-Git-Installation-on-Windows-1-Start.png)

---

### Installation Wizard - Components

In the "Select Components" dialog I suggest that you **uncheck**

- Additional icons and
- Windows Explorer Integration

![Screenshot of the git installation wizard - Adjusting your PATH environment](files/Git-Installation-Process/Screenshot-Git-Installation-on-Windows-2-Select-Components-Diaglog.png)

---

### Installation Wizard - PATH Variable

The installation wizard asks you how it should integrate with your system. Please check "Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt". This will make the "git.exe" avaiable from everywhere in your system.

![Screenshot of the git installation wizard - Select Components](files/Git-Installation-Process/Screenshot-Git-Installation-on-Windows-3-Adjust-System-PATH-Dialog.png)

---

### Installation Wizard - Line Ending Conversion

Because git comes from a Unix background, git uses Unix-style instead of Windows-style line-endings.
You should select the "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" option.

**Windows-style line ending**

Windows uses a carriage return charachter and a line feed character for its line endings:

`"\r\n"`

**Unix-style line ending**

Unix just uses a single line feed charachter for indicating new lines:

`"\n"`

![Screenshot of the git installation wizard - Line Ending Conversion](files/Git-Installation-Process/Screenshot-Git-Installation-on-Windows-4-Checkout-Style-Dialog.png)

[Scott Hanselman - You're just another carriage return line feed in the wall](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YoureJustAnotherCarriageReturnLineFeedInTheWall.aspx)

---

### Installation - bin folder

The git intaller installs a bunch of Windows-compatible Linux commands.

![Screenshot of the git installation - Bin Folder](files/Git-Installation-Process/Screenshot-Git-Installation-on-Windows-6-Bin-Folder.png)

---

### Installation - cmd folder

The cmd-folder contains the git.exe and a script which sets the PATH to the bin folder and then launches a new command prompt.

![Screenshot of the git installation - Bin Folder](files/Git-Installation-Process/Screenshot-Git-Installation-on-Windows-7-cmd-Folder-and-PATH-Environment-Variable.png)

---

### Testing the installation

When the installation was successful when you can execute "git.exe" from all locations on your system:

![Screenshot of the git installation - Command Prompt](files/Git-Installation-Process/Screenshot-Git-Installation-on-Windows-8-Command-Prompt.png)

---

## Configuration

---

### Configuration: Username and Email

---

#### Global Config File (.gitconfig)

The global git configuration is located in a file called .gitconfig in your home directory

	> %UserProfile%\.gitconfig

![](files/Git-Configuration/Screenshot-Git-Configuration-dot-gitconfig-user-name-and-email.png)

---

#### Set Username and Email

In order to set your Username and Email adress for future commits you can either edit the "%UserProfile%\.gitconfig" file in an editor of your choice or use git config command with the `--global` flag:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	> git config --global user.email "andyk7@gmail.com"

![Screenshot set username and email - Set Username and Email with git](files/Git-Configuration/Username-and-Email/Screenshot-Setting-username-and-email-globally-with-git-3-email.png)

---

### Configuration: Merge and Diff Tool

By default git does not ship with much GUI tools and everything is handled in the command-line:

![Screenshot of the gits command-line based diff viewer](files/Git-Configuration/Merge-Tool/Screenshot-gits-default-command-line-diff-tool.png)

But you can configure git to use other diff and merge tools (but this isn't that easy on Windows if you don't use tools which are supported out of the box).

---

### Configuring KDiff3 on Windows

I couldn't get my perferred merging tool [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) to work with git on Windows, but [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/) is also quite nice and can be easily configured to work with git.

**Step 1 - Download and install KDiff3**

http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net

**Step 2 - Extend your .gitconfig**

	[merge]
		tool = kdiff3
	
	[mergetool]
		prompt = false
	
	[mergetool "kdiff3"]
		prompt = false
		path = c:/Program Files (x86)/KDiff3/kdiff3.exe
	
	[diff]
		tool = kdiff3
		guitool = kdiff3
	
	[difftool]
		prompt = false
	
	[difftool "kdiff3"]
		path = c:/Program Files (x86)/KDiff3/kdiff3.exe

![Screenshot of the KDiff3 as the diff and merge tool for git](files/Git-Configuration/Merge-Tool/Screenshot-KDiff3-as-gits-diff-and-merge-tool.png)

It is supposed to be easy to integrate any other merge tool with git. And it is - at least on Unix based systems. But on Windows I haven't found a way yet.

## Working with git

---

### Typical workflows with git

- Creating a repository
- Getting help
- Cloning a repository
- Comparing Commits
- Working with .gitignore files
	- Tracking a .NET project
- Rebasing a single commit on top of another (Cherry Picking)
	- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1191282/git-diff-commits-difference
- Creating a branch
- Committing changes
- Undoing commits
- Reverting changes
- Merging conflicts
- Merging branches
- Pushing changes to a remote location
- Rewriting history
- Rebasing Repositories
- Managing identities

---

### Using the built-in help

Git comes with a comprehensive help documentation which ships with every installation.

**Display an help overview**

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git help

**Get a detailed list of all git commands**

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git help -a


**Help about a specific git command**

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git help <command>

![Screenshot of the git help command result](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Git-Help-Overview.png)

---

### Creating a repository - git init

You can initialize a repository in any directory by using the **init** command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git init

The init command then creates a hidden subdirectory named ".git" that contains all necessary repository meta-data.

![](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Creating-a-repository-with-git-init.png)

---

### The .git metadata folder

The .git folder is where all you commits, branches and tags will be stored, but for now you don't need to bother with the contents of this folder:

![Screenshot of the content of a .git metadata folder](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Git-Metadata-Folder-Content.png)

---

### Checking the status of your repository with git status

You can quickly check which the status of files in your repository/index by using the **status** command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git status

![Using git status to check the index of a repository](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Checking-a-repository-with-git-status.png)

---

### Adding files to the index

Once you have initialized a repository you can create, modify files and add the new files to the **index / staging area**.

**Add one or more files to the index**

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git add <filename1> <filename2>

	> git add .
	Add all files (in the current directory) to the index

**Index / Staging Area**

The index aka "staging area" is a file that contains the files that will go into your next **commit**.

![Screenshot of a git repository where a new README.txt file has been added to the Index aka Staging Area](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Git-Basic-the-index-aka-staging-area.png)

---

### Removing files from the index

You can remove files from the staging area if you have added it accidentally. This means will will not go in your next commit, but the file itself will remain untouched in the folder.

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git rm --cached <filename>

![Screenshot removing a file from the staging area](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Removing-a-file-from-the-index-aka-staging-area.png)

---

### Commiting changes

By commiting you can save all staged files to your (local) repository.

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git commit -m "A first commit"

![Screenshot of a first commit](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Committing-a-change.png)

Once you have executed the commit, all changes are recorded to your repository.

---

### Viewing the commit history

Every commit to a repository is recording and the global history of a repository can be viewed with the "log" command.

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git log

![Screenshot of results of git log](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Viewing-the-complete-git-history-with-log.png)

If you only want to see latest n-commits you can use the `-n` flag for the log command:

**Show only the latest 3 commits**
<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git log -n 3

![Results of git log -n 3 as a screenshot](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Viewing-the-last-n-commits-of-the-git-history-with-log-n.png)

Or you can use **gitk** to a view a graphical representation of your commit history:

![Using gitk to view the local commit history](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Viewing-the-git-history-with-gitk.png)

---

### Undoing your last local commit

If you have accidentally committed a change you can undo your change by using the "reset" command:

On Windows:
<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git reset --soft HEAD~1
	
On Linux:
<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git reset --soft HEAD^

![](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Undo-the-last-local-commit.png)

Note: this does not work for your first commit ;-)

[more details](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/undo-last-git-commit)

---

### Correcting a commit message

If you want to change the message of your last commit you can simply type:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git commit --amend

This command opens up a text editor in which you can simple change the text of your last commit message. Or you can use the `-m` parameter to enter the message directly:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git commit --amend -m "Your new commit message text"

![](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Amending-the-last-local-commit-message.png)

**Note**: Changing the commit message will change the hash of your commit. Therefor you should use this technique carefully if you already pushed your repository to a remote location that is used by other developers.

[more details](http://git-scm.com/book/ch6-4.html)

---

### Reverting a public commit

If you want to take back a commit which has already been pushed to another location can cannot simply "undo" it, because public history cannot be changed. But you can add a commit which **reverts** another commit.

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git revert <hash of the commit to revert>

git revert applies the inverse of a given commit.

![Screenshot of the text editor window that is displayed when a revert is being performed](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Revert-a-commit-message-editor.png)

![Result of git revert](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Revert-a-commit-result.png)

---

### Comparing commits

In order to visualize the changes between two commits you can use the **diff** command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git diff <commit-A> <commit-B>

The command will display the differences between the two commits directly in the command line:

![Screenshot of git diff in action](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/git-diff-command-line.png)

If you prefer a nice visualization of the differences between two commits you can use the **difftool** command instead. The command will open the diff tool you have configured in your .gitconfig.

![Screenshot of git diff in action](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/git-difftool-comparing-commits.png)

---

### Git ignore files

If you want to make sure certain files are never added to your index and therefor never commited you can list these files in a file called ".gitignore".

**Example: Ignoring .html files**

	*.html

![Screenshot of an git ignore file](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Git-ignore.png)

---

### An ignore file for .NET projects

The content of an ingore file for .NET projects typically looks something like this:

	[Oo]bj
	[Bb]in
	*.user
	*.suo
	*.[Cc]ache
	*.bak
	*.ncb
	*.log 
	*.DS_Store
	[Tt]humbs.db 
	_ReSharper.*
	*.resharper


All files which match the patterns specified here will not be added to the index when using "git add ."


[more details](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2143956/gitignore-for-visual-studio-projects-and-solutions)

---

### Show a list of local branches

The default branch in git is called "master". To display a list of all branches in your current repository use the "branch" command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git branch


![Show local branches](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Show-Branches.png)

The branch that is marked with an asterisk (*) is the branch you are currently on.

---

### Show al list of all branches

To display a complete list of all local and remote branches you can use the `-a` flag.

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git branch -a

![Show all branches](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Show-all-Branhces.png)

---

### Creating a branch

To create a new branch use the "branch" command with the name of your new branch:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git branch <branch-name>

![Create a new branch](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Creating-a-new-Branch.png)

---

### Switching between branches

To switch your current repository context to another branch you can use the "checkout" command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git checkout <branch-name>

![Switching a branch](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Switching-a-branch.png)

---

### Merging branches without no conflicts

To merge a branch into another use the "merge" command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git merge <branch-name>

![Switching a branch](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Merging-branches-no-conflicts.png)

If the merge can be performed without conflicts you will see the commits from the merged branch in your current branch.

---

### Merging branches with conflicts

If git cannot decide on how to merge changes you will get a **merge conflict** which needs to be **resolved** and **committed**:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git merge <branch-name>
	CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in ...
	Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result

![Screenshot of a merge with results in a conflict](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Merge-branch-with-conflict-1.png)

You can resolve the conflict with the "mergetool" command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git mergetool

![Screenshot of the mergetool resolving a conflict](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Merge-branch-with-conflict-3-Merge-tool.png)

After you have resolved the conflict, you need to stage the changes and commit them:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git add <file-with-conflict>
	> git commit -m "Merged with branch xy"

![Results of a branch merge with conflicts after the conflict has been resovled](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Merge-branch-with-conflict-4-Merge-Result.png)

---

### Deleting a local branch

Local branches can be easily deleted:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git branch -d <name-of-the-branch>

![Deleting a local branch with git branch -d branchname](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Deleting-a-local-branch.png)

---

### Deleting a remote branch

In order to delete a branch which has been pushed to a remote location you need to use a different command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git push origin --delete <branchName>

or

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git push origin :<branchName>


![Deleting a remote branch with git push origin --delete branchname](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Deleting-a-remote-branch.png)

[more details](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-both-locally-and-in-github)

---

### Cloning a repository

In order to retrieve a copy of an existing repository you can use the **clone** command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git clone <Path-or-URL>

This will clone the repository behind the specified URL or path into a new directory in the current location.

For example you can clone the repository of this presentation from github:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git clone https://github.com/andreaskoch/Introduction-to-Distributed-Source-Code-Management-with-git.git

![Cloning a repository from github](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Cloning-a-remote-repository-from-github.png)

---

### Pulling from another repository

Instead of cloning another repository you can also pull from it into your existing repository.

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> mkdir NewRepo
	> cd NewRepo
	> git init
	> git pull <Path-or-URL>

![Pulling changes into an existing repository](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Pulling-changes-from-a-remote-repository-into-local-repository.png)

---

### Pushing changes to a remote repository

If you want to publish your changes to a remote repository you can use the **push** command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git push <name of the remote> <branchname>

**Remote** := A remote is a version of a project that is located at another location.

---

## Display a list of all remotes

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git remote -v

![List all remotes of a repository](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/List-all-remotes.png)

---

### Adding a remote

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git remote add <name of the remote> <Path-or-URL-of-the-Repository>

![Adding a remote repository](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Adding-a-remote.png)

---

### Pulling changes from a remote location

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git pull <name of the remote> <branchname>

---

### Fetching changes from a remote location

git pull will downlaod all changes from the remote respository and merge them with your current branch. If you only want to download the changes without merging them you can use **fetch** instead of **pull**:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git fetch <name of the remote> <branchname>

---

### Cleaning up a repository

If you want to delete all files from your current repository which are not part of your repository and have not been added to the index / stating area you can use the **clean** command:

<!-- language: lang-sh -->

	> git clean -df

![Screenshot of git clean in action](files/Git-Workflows/Basics/Git-clean.png)
